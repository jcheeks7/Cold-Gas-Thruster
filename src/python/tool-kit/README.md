# Cold Gas Propulsion Toolkit

A modular Python toolkit for modeling, sizing, and simulating cold gas propulsion systems. Designed for aerospace engineers and students to estimate performance, size hardware, and visualize system behavior from first principles.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Core Flow Modeling**: Calculates mass flow rate, exit velocity, Mach number, and thrust
* **Sizing Tools**: Computes required propellant mass, total impulse, tank volume, and achievable delta-v
* **Nozzle Design**: Supports Mach-area relationships, exit geometry, and expansion ratio analysis
* **Tank Modeling**: Ideal gas storage, MEOP calculation, and burst pressure estimation
* **Time-Step Simulation**: Models pressure and mass over time with plotting support
